title: "draw()"
description: "The draw() function executes continuously."
---

The `draw()` function runs in a loop until `noLoop()` is called.

### New Update  
This is an additional sentence that should trigger an update check.

> Added a new note about performance improvements.

### Additional Information  
The `draw()` function continuously executes the code within until `noLoop()` is called.  
This function is essential for creating animations and dynamic sketches.

### Controlling Frame Rate  
You can use `frameRate(fps)` inside `setup()` to control how fast `draw()` executes.  
By default, `draw()` runs at 60 frames per second (fps), but you can adjust this based on your needs.  
For example, `frameRate(30)` reduces the speed by half.
